## Part 2

**1)Method of complements** 
> The method of complements is a technique used to subtract one number from another using only addition of positive numbers. This method was commonly used in mechanical calculators and is still used in modern computers. 

**2)Byte** 
> The byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits, representing a binary number. Historically, the byte was the number of bits used to encode a single character of text in a computer and for this reason it is the smallest addressable unit of memory in many computer architectures. 

**3)Integer (computer science)** 
> An integer is a datum of integral data type, a data type that represents some range of mathematical integers. Integral data types may be of different sizes and may or may not be allowed to contain negative values. Integers are commonly represented in a computer as a group of binary digits (bits). The size of the grouping varies so the set of integer sizes available varies between different types of computers. Computer hardware, including virtual machines, nearly always provide a way to represent a processor register or memory address as an integer. 

**4)Floating point** 
> Floating-point arithmetic (FP) is arithmetic using formulaic representation of real numbers as an approximation so as to support a trade-off between range and precision. For this reason, floating-point computation is often found in systems which include very small and very large real numbers, which require fast processing times. A number is, in general, represented approximately to a fixed number of significant digits (the significand) and scaled using an exponent in some fixed base; the base for the scaling is normally two, ten, or sixteen.


  
  
### 仔细阅读” Method of complements”的内容，你将注意到nines‘ complement in the decimal 和 ones’ complement in binary 等概念. 
1) 证明：
在无符号数表示中，我们有从 0 开始到范围的最大值。（这里，我们先讨论一字节，即八位二进制位，的情况。）而在有符号数的表示中，我们将后半部分平移至数轴原点左侧，即用正数代表负数。又易知，八位二进制位中，最大值为 2^0 + 2^1 + …… + 2^7 = 2^8-1，即255，故任意范围内的负数 a（a < 0） 可由 b = 255 + a + 1 表示，其中，末尾需要 +1 ，因为我们是从 0 开始计数，并非只有正数。  
又，任何十进制的数均可用二进制表示，即范围内的十进制数可化成与之对应的二进制数，故 (a)<sub>2</sub> 可以由 (b + 1)<sub>2</sub> = (b)<sub>2</sub> + 1 来表示。  
故可推广知，在 k 位二进制位数中（其中，k 为正整数）, 负数 a 可由与之对应的 b = 2^k - 1 + a + 1 = 2^k + a （其中，a，b均可转化为二进制）来表示。
