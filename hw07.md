# 我的作业

1、Program with machine language according to the following c.  
int_8 a = 1;  
int_8 c = a + 3;  

1）Write your assembly code & machine code.  
LOD #1  
STO X  
LOD X  
ADD #3   
LOD X  
STO Y  


2）Explain machine code execution with the fetch-decode-execute cycle.    
从 Main Memory 到 Control Unit 有 fetch the instruction 和 decode the instruction，然后 execute the instruction 最后返回 Main Memory.


3）Explain functions about IR, PC, ACC registers in a CPU.   
IR：指令寄存器，用来保存当前正在执行的一条指令   
PC：程序计数器，存放下一条指令在内存中的地址   
ACC：累加寄存器，功能是当运算器的算术逻辑单元(ALU)执行全部算术和逻辑运算时，为ALU提供一个工作区，暂时存放ALU运算结果  

4）Explain physical meaning about vars a & c in a machine.  
a 的值为 1 = (001)<sub>2</sub>  
c 的值为 4 = (100)<sub>2</sub>    
and运算：a & c = 0
物理意义是 ALU 中获取到的数据，按照与门电路链接，根据高低电平，做出逻辑运算。 

2、简答题  
1）What are stored in memory?  
数据和指令。

2）Can a data or a instruction stored in the same place?  
YES.

3） Explain Instruction Format with example instructions.   
ADD X :00000000 10000000

3、解释以下词汇
1）汇编语言（Assembly Language）  

>An assembly (or assembler) language, often abbreviated asm, is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the program's statements and the architecture's machine code instructions.

2）编译（Compiler）  

>A compiler is computer software that primarily translates computer code from a high-level programming language to machine code to create an executable program. A compiler can also be used to convert computer code written in one programming language into another programming language. Technically compilers are a type of translator that support digital devices, primarily computers.

3）命令式语言（Imperative programming）  

>In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.

4）函数编程语言（Functional programming）  

>In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements. In functional code, the output value of a function depends only on the arguments that are passed to the function, so calling a function f twice with the same value for an argument x produces the same result f(x) each time; this is in contrast to procedures depending on a local or global state, which may produce different results at different times when called with the same arguments but a different program state. Eliminating side effects, i.e., changes in state that do not depend on the function inputs, can make it much easier to understand and predict the behavior of a program, which is one of the key motivations for the development of functional programming.

5）过程式编程（Procedural programming）  

>Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions, simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out. Any given procedure might be called at any point during a program's execution, including by other procedures or itself. The first major procedural programming languages first appeared circa 1960, including Fortran, ALGOL, COBOL and BASIC. Pascal and C were published closer to the 1970s.
