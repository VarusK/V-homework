##### 1. According to the von Neumann architecture, List basic parts of a computer.  
① Input Device  
② Output Device  
③ Central Processing Unit  
   (Control Unit + Arithmetic/Logic Unit)  
④ Memory Unit  
⑤ Auxiliary Storage Device  

##### 2. A computer has 64 MB (megabytes) of memory. How many bits are needed to address any single byte in memory?  
64MB = 2<sup>6</sup> * 2<sup>20</sup> = 2<sup>26</sup> bytes. 
所以 需要log<sub>2</sub> 2<sup>26</sup> = 26 个 bits.

##### 3. List basic parts of a CPU, include cache or not?   
不包括。缓存不是必要的，不属于 CPU 的基本组成部分。
##### 4. What mean secondary storage. List some on your PC.     
Secondary Storage:外存储器（辅助存储器）。  
电脑上的硬盘，随身携带的 U 盘、光盘等。

##### 5. 使用维基百科，解释以下概念：  
CPU
>A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions. The computer industry has used the term "central processing unit" at least since the early 1960s. Traditionally, the term "CPU" refers to a processor, more specifically to its processing unit and control unit (CU), distinguishing these core elements of a computer from external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry.

RAM.  
>Random-access memory (RAM) is a form of computer data storage that stores data and machine code currently being used. A random-access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory. In contrast, with other direct-access data storage media such as hard disks, CD-RWs, DVD-RWs and the older magnetic tapes and drum memory, the time required to read and write data items varies significantly depending on their physical locations on the recording medium, due to mechanical limitations such as media rotation speeds and arm movement.

ROM.  
>Read-only memory (ROM) is a type of non-volatile memory used in computers and other electronic devices. Data stored in ROM can only be modified slowly, with difficulty, or not at all, so it is mainly used to store firmware (software that is closely tied to specific hardware, and unlikely to need frequent updates) or application software in plug-in cartridges.  
Strictly, read-only memory refers to memory that is hard-wired, such as diode matrix and the later mask ROM (MROM), which cannot be changed after manufacture. Although discrete circuits can be altered in principle, integrated circuits (ICs) cannot, and are useless if the data is bad or requires an update. That such memory can never be changed is a disadvantage in many applications, as bugs and security issues cannot be fixed, and new features cannot be added.  

Bus (computing).  
>In computer architecture, a bus (a contraction of the Latin omnibus) is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer, or between computers. This expression covers all related hardware components (wire, optical fiber, etc.) and software, including communication protocols.
Early computer buses were parallel electrical wires with multiple hardware connections, but the term is now used for any physical arrangement that provides the same logical function as a parallel electrical bus. Modern computer buses can use both parallel and bit serial connections, and can be wired in either a multidrop (electrical parallel) or daisy chain topology, or connected by switched hubs, as in the case of USB.

Parallel Computing.
>Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously. Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time. There are several different forms of parallel computing: bit-level, instruction-level, data, and task parallelism. Parallelism has long been employed in high-performance computing, but it's gaining broader interest due to the physical constraints preventing frequency scaling. As power consumption (and consequently heat generation) by computers has become a concern in recent years, parallel computing has become the dominant paradigm in computer architecture, mainly in the form of multi-core processors.

##### 6. 写一段文字，简单解释“云计算（cloud computing）”  
在一开始个人电脑 PC 被造出来的初期，对于一个对计算等操作需求量不大用户，可能一个硬盘和一个性能一般的CPU就可以满足需求。   
但随着科技进步，用户对数据的计算处理需求量逐渐增大，增大到一个 PC 不好解决，这时候，可能需要两台，也可能需要更多。这就需要设备具有更多的空间灵活性和时间灵活性。首先是物理层面的设备，我们可以通过物理设备的增加来应付，然而物理设备不能做到很好的灵活性。于是就有人提出虚拟化。数据中心的物理设备都很强大，可以从物理的CPU，内存，硬盘中虚拟出一小块来给客户，同时也可以虚拟出一小块来给其他客户，每个客户都只能看到自己虚的那一小块，其实每个客户用的是整个大的设备上其中的一小块。虚拟化的技术能使得不同的客户的电脑看起来是隔离的，实际情况可能我这个 10G 和你这个 10G 是落在同样一个很大很大的这个存储上的。而且如果事先物理设备都准备好，虚拟化软件虚拟出一个电脑是非常快的，基本上几分钟就能解决。所以在任何一个云上要创建一台电脑，一点几分钟就出来了，就是这个道理。这个空间灵活性和时间灵活性就基本解决了。  
云计算是什么？通俗理解就是有一个云厂商已经建立好了自来水井，也铺好了自来水管道，我们直接拿被子取干净的水就好了，这就是一套自来水系统。不用再去打水井，铺管道，提高了时间效率，也大大降低了人力成本。

##### 7. 小孙买了计算机主板，说明书表明“支持双通道DDR3-1333内存，最大支持16G”
1) DDR3内存，“3”和“1333”的含义是什么？  
3指：第三代(双倍数据率同步动态随机存取存储器)。   
1333指：默认额定工作频率为 1333MHZ.  

2) 小孙买8G DDR3-1600的内存能提高性能吗？   
主板不支持，买8G DDR3-1600的内存条也会被识别成8G DDR3-1333，不能提高性能。  

3) 小孙买4G * 2 DDR3-1333的内存能提高性能吗？    
买双通道 4G * 2 DDR3-1333内存，可以提高存取速度来提升电脑的性能。  

4) 16G 需要多少位地址？   
16G = 2<sup>4</sup> * 2<sup>30</sup> = 2<sup>34</sup> bytes
所以需要 log<sub>2</sub> 2<sup>34</sup> = 34 位地址。  

备注，维基百科（中文）“DDR3 SDRAM”:
>Double data rate type three SDRAM (DDR3 SDRAM) is a type of synchronous dynamic random-access memory (SDRAM) with a high bandwidth ("double data rate") interface, and has been in use since 2007. It is the higher-speed successor to DDR and DDR2 and predecessor to DDR4 synchronous dynamic random-access memory (SDRAM) chips. DDR3 SDRAM is neither forward nor backward compatible with any earlier type of random-access memory (RAM) because of different signaling voltages, timings, and other factors.
